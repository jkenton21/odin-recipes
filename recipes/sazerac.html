    <p>The Sazerac offers a unique flavor experience for rye whiskey. 
    The recipe is simple, accenting the spicy rye with sugar, bitters, and an anise 
    liqueur, such as absinthe. That last ingredient makes this drink special, and it's even
    better with the new crop of amazing ryes on the market today</p>
