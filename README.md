# odin-recipes

In this project I will be creating a basic website for cocktail recipes.

The website will have a main page and links to other pages for each recipe.
Each page will have links with proper naviagtion back to the home page.
This project will demonstrate my knowledge of html basics with use of links, images, headers, lists, and paragraphs.
